 * 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

 
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 

Constraints:
0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

  const charMap = {};
  let stringStart = 0;

      stringStart = charMap[currentChar] + 1;

    largestStringLength = Math.max(largestStringLength, i + 1 - stringStart);
    charMap[currentChar] = i;

  return largestStringLength;
